          <p class = "two">“I want our young people to know that they matter. That they belong.
            So don’t be afraid. Do you hear me? Young people, don’t be afraid.
            Be focused. Be determined. Be hopeful. Be empowered. Empower yourselves
             with a good education. Then get out there and use that education to
             build a country worthy of your boundless promise. Lead by example
             with hope, never fear, and know that I will be with you, rooting for
             you and working to support you for the rest of my life.” –
